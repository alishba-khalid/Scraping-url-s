🔗 Web URL Scraper in Python
A beginner-friendly Python project that extracts all unique internal links from any given website and saves them into a CSV file.

This project uses the power of requests, BeautifulSoup, and urllib to navigate a webpage, find internal links (same domain), and export them for analysis or SEO research.

 ##Features##
✅ Scrapes all internal (same-domain) links from a webpage

✅ Filters only HTTP/HTTPS links

✅ Ensures uniqueness using Python sets

✅ Saves results to a .csv file

✅ Includes helpful error handling for bad URLs or network issues

✅ Clean, readable, and well-commented code

🛠 ##Technologies Used##
requests – to fetch webpage content

BeautifulSoup (from bs4) – to parse HTML

urllib.parse – to handle URL paths and domains

csv – to export the scraped links

📂 ##File Output##
The program will create a file called:

unique_urls.csv

Each internal link found will be stored in its own row under the URL column.
